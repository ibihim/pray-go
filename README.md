# Pray-go

Get the next prayer time from https://api.aladhan.com/

This means it doesn't calculate anything, but picks times from a free API.

Don't trust it blindly, bugs are possible.
I don't take blame for missed prayers.

## Usage

```bash
  prayer next [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --city string     City name (default "Berlin")
  -h, --help            help for next
  -l, --list-files      List all files
  -n, --nation string   Country name (default "Germany")
  -s, --nocache         Do not cache the prayer times
```
